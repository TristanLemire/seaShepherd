## Setup

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

```bash
npm i # install dependencies
```

We are using postgres and knex for our database, if you don't have it, run the following command: 

```bash
npm run installall
```

Then you have to create the db, you can do it with the following command: 
```bash
createdb sea-shepherd
```

Once it's done, you can import the database with this command: 

```bash
psql sea-shepherd < dbexport.pgsql
```

---

## Export the DB

```
pg_dump sea-shepherd > dbexport.pgsql
```
